My very own task list! 

I just decided to create my own task list for fun. 

It's pretty much a C++ console application that allow me to add a tasks, delete tasks, and view the list of tasks.   

So far, it has been light and efficient on my system! I am talking like 29 MBs on the memory at very least.

Only con at the moment: It doesn't save.  

.. I could have just used notepad since it uses similar amount of the memory-- but I preferred a dedicated application over notepad, anyways.
